# Overview of Spring Boot

## What is Spring Boot?
Spring Boot is a powerful and convention-over-configuration-based framework for building modern, stand-alone, and production-grade Spring-based Applications. It simplifies the process of creating robust, scalable, and maintainable applications by providing sensible defaults and removing much of the boilerplate code associated with Java development.

## Key Features of Spring Boot
1. Rapid Development:
- Accelerates development by minimizing boilerplate code and providing sensible defaults.
2. Convention Over Configuration:
- Adopts conventions to reduce explicit configuration, allowing developers to focus on business logic.
3. Embedded Servers:
- Includes embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow), simplifying deployment as standalone JAR or WAR files.
4. Auto-Configuration:
- Offers automatic configuration for common components, reducing the need for manual setup.
5. Microservices Architecture:
- Ideal for building independent, scalable microservices with built-in support for microservices patterns.
6. Starters:
- Provides pre-built templates (Starters) for quick setup of dependencies, streamlining development.
7. Dependency Management:
- Simplifies dependency management through starters and centralized management.
