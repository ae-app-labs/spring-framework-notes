# Overview of Spring Framework

## What is Spring Framework
- A powerful tool for building software using the Java programming language.
- Makes it easier to create large and complex applications.

## How Does it Work?
### Dependency Injection (DI)
- It helps us manage how different parts of our program work together.
- Imagine getting help (dependencies) when you need them instead of finding them yourself.

### Inversion of Control (IoC)
- Instead of controlling everything in our program, we let Spring control how things connect.
- Think of it like letting Spring organize a big puzzle where the pieces (components) fit together.

## What Can You Do with Spring?
### Spring Modules
#### Core Container:
- Manages basic building blocks (beans) of your program.
- Makes sure everything starts and stops correctly.

#### Data Access:
- Helps your program talk to databases.
- Ensures data transactions happen smoothly.

#### Spring MVC:
- Manages how your program handles web requests.
- Splits the work into model, view, and controller.

#### Spring Security:
- Adds security features to your program.
- Takes care of who can access what.

#### Spring Boot:
- Makes it super easy to start a new project.
- Handles a lot of setup automatically.

## Cool Features of Spring
### Annotation-Based Configuration
- Special instructions you can add to your code.
- Makes your code neater and tells Spring what to do.

### Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
- Helps manage common tasks that happen across your program.
- Like a superhero that takes care of common problems.

### Convention Over Configuration
- Spring Boot guesses what you want to do without you telling it everything.
- Saves you from writing lots of repetitive code.

### Spring Security
- Easily add security features without much work.
- Makes sure only the right people access your program.
